This is a glover romhack project intended to become a practice tool for speedrunning.

How to build?

I recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux if you are on Windows. 
A lot of tools used are related to Linux so this is the easiest way of building it for now and I primarily developed 
this on Linux.
How to install WSL:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 
I tested this with Debian GNU/Linux WSL. 

After WSL is set up run the following commands.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc g++ make python3 git coreutils build-essential wget texinfo libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
git clone https://github.com/ARM9/bass.git && cd bass/bass && make && sudo make install
cd
git clone https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch
chmod +x ./glovepatch.py
cd glover_patch
mkdir rom
explorer.exe .

Now you can browse the glover patch folder that contains almost everything you need to patch the rom.
Navigate to glover\rom and copy a NTSC rom of glover into it. The filename must be "glover_base_ntsc.z64".
Once done go back to WSL and run the last command:

make

Now inside of the rom folder you will find a file called glover_patched.z64. This is the final patched rom.

To make this you will need gcc-mips-linux-gnu installed.
