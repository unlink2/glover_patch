# Save Files

Save files are located at

|Region|Address|
|---|---|
|NTSC|0x801EAA44|

C Struct definition

```c
typedef struct save_file {
    char filename[4];
    u32 levels_cleared[2];
    u32 score;
    u8 unknown_1;
    u8 difficulty; // 00 = easy, 01 == normal
    u8 ball_counter;
    u8 hub_progress;
    u32 unknown_2;
    u32 settings; // sound, etc
} save_file;
```

The current file is stored at

|Region|Address|
|---|---|
|NTSC|0x801EAB24|

Interestingly the developers used a 16 bit integer to represent the current file meaning
memory regions far outside the file array can be loaded as "files".
A lot of them will actually load the game just fine. The hub progress decides which initial hub is loaded, but if
a hub id is outside its intended range other maps may be used instead.
Another oddity is that the sound settings may be outside of normal values. This causes serious distortion.

There is enough room for 6 save files that can be normally reached using the file select menu
and an additional file used in demos and level select.
The files are in a simple array.

Detailed memory layout based on current information:

<span id="saveFileMemory">
</span>

<script>
    window.onload = () => {
        // drawMemoryLayout({}, 'saveFileMemory');
    }
</script>
