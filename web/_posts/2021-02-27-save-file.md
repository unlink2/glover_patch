C Struct definition

```c
typedef struct save_file {
    char filename[4];
    u32 levels_cleared[2];
    u32 score;
    u8 unknown_1;
    u8 difficulty; // 00 = easy, 01 == normal
    u8 ball_counter;
    u8 hub_progress;
    u32 unknown_2;
    u32 settings; // sound, etc
} save_file;
```

There is enough room for 6 save files that can be normally reached using the file select menu
and an additional file used in demos and level select.
The files are in a simple array.
