## How to add information to the wiki

Generally all wiki pages are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
To add information to any page simply get the [glover repository](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch),
[fork it](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Funlink2%2Fglover_patch)
and navigate to the [web subdirectory](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch/tree/master/web).

In there you will find .md files (like [contributing.md](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch/blob/master/web/contributing.md))
Simply edit those and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch/pulls).

That's it! Once the pull request has been approved the page will go live automatically!

Markdown is very simple and is pretty much just *fancy text* so don't be afraid of submitting a pull request even
if you do not know how to write code :)

## How to write code

To install all the tools required to develop actual code please refer to the [readme](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch/blob/master/README).

Once you have done that simply fork the repository and implement your feature of choice.
In general you should be able to research how the game does things using a debugger.
The hack has full access to the N64s hardware and can do anything you want.
