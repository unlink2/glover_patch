# Glover Speedrun Practice Hack

![](https://github.com/unlink2/glover_patch/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

## Easy Install:

To easily install a non-dev build use the web-builder which can be found here:
https://glover.run

## Note for Porject64 Users:

When using Project64 please use GlideN64 Video Plugin or ANgrylion.
They give the best results. The only big issue on PJ64 is that the
memory monitor cursor does not render on Glide, but if you're running on emulator
you likely will not need it anyway.


## How to build from source?

I recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux if you are on Windows.
A lot of tools used are related to Linux so this is the easiest way of building it for now and I primarily developed this on Linux.
### How to install WSL:

I tested this with Debian GNU/Linux WSL.

### Initial Build

# TODO
Install rustup and cargo-binutils
